The GPC (Gameplay Client) has been implemented (TCP only so far), and connects happily, exchanges data, and both the GPC and the GPS seem to handle common errors elegantly. Next up, I implement the UDP component of the GPC, test everything out for a bit, then it's time to dust everything off and rig up some online gameplay. It's getting close now folks.
