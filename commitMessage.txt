I added a bunch of features while sipping my strawberry frappuccino and daintily munching on my apple fritter at Starbucks -- when I was supposed to be in chemistry class. The point that I'm getting at, is that all of these features are completely untested because I didn't have access to two computers and an internet conection.

- Interpolation for Nanoshooter Entity
- Network removes GameState users on disconnect
- LocalGame removes entities that have non-existant owners/controllers.
- Temporary text-chat added.

I'm going to test and debug all of this now.
