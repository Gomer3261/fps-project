# First Person Shooter Project #

---

For a long period of time, we were casually working on an online multiplayer first-person shooter made in the Blender Game Engine.

Recently, me (Chase) and Geoff have begun rewriting everything. Again... :)
We're focusing on completing an online multiplayer experience in the BGE, which we of course intend to release as open source to the community for others to dissect, and use in their own projects.

People involved:
  * Chase Moskal (Chaser)
  * Geoff Gollmer (Gomer)
  * Martins Upitis (Martinsh)
  * Mitchell Stokes (Moguri)
  * Daniel Stokes (Kupoman)
  * Lonnie Ralfs (Loonietoon)
  * Fleeky Flanco (Fleeky)
  * Thomas Lobig
