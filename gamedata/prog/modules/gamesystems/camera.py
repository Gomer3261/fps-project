	#### ================================================
	# Okay, so this is where we decide which camera becomes the active_camera.
	# First off, the new cam will always default to being the emergency cam.
	# That is, if no other cameras are available, we can always fall back on
	# the emergency camera (ecam).
	
	# What you see below, is a stack of if statements that may set the new cam.
	# As you'd discover, lower statements take priority. The Player's fpcam should
	# always be at the bottom of the stack, because the player's fpcam always takes
	# priority over all other cameras.
	#### ================================================
