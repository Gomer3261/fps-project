### GameplayServer Networking Module ###

class Class:
	"""
	GameplayServer Networking.
	
	The gpsnet is used by any part of the game, usually entities, to access and manipulate the GameState
	of the host, be it local, or remote over the internet.
	
	Master Public Interface:
		- run(MasterInfo): Performs special high-level operations like connecting, reconnecting, etc.
		- incoming(): Receives data from a remote host.
		- outgoing(LocalGame): Sends data from the out buffers (sendBuffer and throwBuffer) to 
			the host. When you are playing offline, you are the host, and in this case the data
			is just fed back to the in buffers (no real networking required).
	
	Lower-level Public Interface:
		- send(package): sends a package (by placing it in the sendBuffer, where it is later handled by the outgoing loop).
		- throw(package): sends a package over UDP (by placing it in the throwBuffer, where it is later handled by the outgoing loop).
		- getinItems(): gets a list of items we have received this tick. These items will be cleared next tick.
