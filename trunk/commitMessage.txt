The server no longer starts automatically -- you must provoke it with the terminal (see the in-game terminal for details).
You can now spawn any entity type with the /spawn('entityType') command -- but for now your options are 'nanoshooter' and 'explorer'. For laughs and giggles go ahead and spawn both at the same time.
You can now only spawn one of each type of entity at one given moment.
Lots of old/deprecated crap removed.
Various tweaks and improvements.
